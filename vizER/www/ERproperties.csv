ER Property,Description
ER_seqnames,"chromosome (1-22, X or Y)"
ER_start,start position 
ER_end,end position
ER_width,total length in base pairs of ER
tissue,the tissue from which the RNA was extracted and sequenced to derive the ER 
mean_coverage," a annotation agnostic measure of read depth (i.e. the mean number of reads overlapping each base of the ER, averaged across all samples from the GTEx tissue)"
ensembl_grch38_v92_region_annot,"which genomic features (exon, intron, intergenic) the ER overlaps according to Ensembl v92"
overlap_any_gene_v92_name,which genes the ER overlaps according to Ensembl v92
 split_read_annotation_type ,"- whether the ER has an overlapping split read (a read with a gapped alignment to the genome)
- partially annotated denotes split reads with one of the acceptor or donor overlapping a known exonic region
 unannotated denotes split reads that have neither acceptor or donor overlapping a known exonic region"
split_read_to_any_gene,whether the split read connects to any gene according to Ensembl v92
 mean_CDTS_percentile,mean percentile of human-specific constraint across the ER (1 being the most constrained)
mean_phast_cons_7,mean conservation (7 mammals) across the ER (0 - 1 with 1 being the most conserved)
mean_phast_cons_100,"mean conservation (100 vertebrates) across the ER (0 - 1 with 1 being the most conserved)
