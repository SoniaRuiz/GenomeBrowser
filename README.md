## Description
This repository contains the User Interface (UI) code for the vizER platform.

Additionally, on the Wiki section, there is available a [tutorial](https://github.com/SoniaRuiz/vizER/wiki) that fully explain the configuration needed to be able to install and expose vizER in a Linux web server environment.

## Getting Started
