# vizER
A platform that enables the visualisation of individual genes for evidence of reannotation.  

## Description
This repository contains the User Interface (UI) code for the vizER platform.

Additionally, on the Wiki section, there are available a collection of tutorials that fully explain the configuration needed to be able to install and expose vizER in a Linux web server environment.

## Getting Started
vizER platform is fully working and can be reached following [this link](https://snca.atica.um.es/browser/app/vizER).
